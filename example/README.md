## Details ##

This is a reimplementation of [Mike Bostock's example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/929623) using `d3-link-register`, a node module which helps manage 

**Click to add nodes!** Nodes near the cursor will be linked to the new node.

**Shift-Click to remove nodes**

[D3](http://d3js.org/)'s force layout uses the Barnesâ€“Hut approximation to compute repulsive charge forces between all nodes efficiently. Links are implemented as geometric constraints on top of position Verlet integration, offering greater stability. A virtual spring between each node and the center of the chart prevents nodes from drifting into space.
